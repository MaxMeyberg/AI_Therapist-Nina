# Run our Multimodal Agent Prototype ‚öôÔ∏è:

We experiment with new prompts, features, etc. using our terminal prototype in the `prototype` folder. Our latest experiments feature
voice therapy solutions using ElevenLabs APIs.

(Aside: Chat with our voice agent directly in the browser [here](https://elevenlabs.io/app/talk-to?agent_id=aB08fUqZnmePxNvmkWTM))

To run the agent, make sure you're in the root directory and run:
```bash
poetry run python prototype/run.py
```
From then on, follow the instructions in the terminal. Press Ctrl+C or type 'exit' to quit.

**[FEATURE TODD IN FUTURE] Note: When testing voice features, use headphones to prevent audio feedback.**

# Developer Culture üîß
- If you're working on a task, create an issue for it and assign it to yourself. Write updates as comments on your issue until you complete your task, upon which you can close your issue.
- If you're writing new code, create a branch with the naming format "FIRSTNAME-BRANCH-REASON" (for example, winson-cot-prompts).
- The main branch should ideally never have any bugs, and represents our overall progress. **Commits should only be pushed to main in the cases of (1) minor bug fixes or (2) markdown file updates.**
- When you want to merge your changes to main, submit a pull request and have another team member review your code prior to completing the merge. For cleanliness, make sure to delete your branch after it's been merged.
